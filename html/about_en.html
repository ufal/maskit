MasKIT is an on-line tool and REST API service for pseudonymization and anonymization of Czech legal texts.
Taking a plain text as input (e.g., a letter sent by a legal authority to a citizen), it runs external services for dependency parsing and named entity recognition
and then identifies and replaces personal information in the text.
